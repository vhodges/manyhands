//! The mutation boundary: how a front end's request to change Manyhands
//! state is identified, recorded and answered.
//!
//! This holds what identifies a request and the records that link a
//! request ID to its command, target, input digest, operations and result.
//! The records are not a journal: they hold no step, no lease and no
//! authority over Git. Losing them loses the ability to answer a retry
//! from memory, never the ability to work.
