# Wave 02 Cycle 05 execution ledger

Ticket: `01K7F6H9J2N4Q6S8V0X2Z4B6DD`
Branch: `manyhands/ticket/01K7F6H9J2N4Q6S8V0X2Z4B6DD`
Worktree: `/home/vhodges/work/src/manyhands/.manyhands/worktrees/01K7F6H9J2N4Q6S8V0X2Z4B6DD`
Plan: [approved implementation plan](2026-10-06-wave-02-cycle-05-clean-deliberate-synchronization-implementation.md)

## Authority and preflight — 2026-10-06

The user confirmed the plans are done and approved, requested starting Cycle 05,
and selected **subagent-driven tasks**. Implementation and local checkpoint
commits are authorized. Push/PR, merge, ticket closure, and cleanup are not.

The worktree held only existing approved planning edits. Preserved them in local
checkpoint `bbdfc74` before rebase; no stash/reset/clean was used. Fresh fetch
observed main `29f3f5a25957836a8513cba8a318306e1b928063`. Local main matches it.
Before checkpoint HEAD: `e6eff2654c2785250418a9df64d6710a04f0872a`.
Before rebase HEAD: `bbdfc74`.
After rebase HEAD: `7f80e8d124b2639bf2f43403693bf0f78aba5ad0`.
Rebase completed without conflicts; fetched-main ancestry and clean status
verified. Rebased `AGENTS.md` is unchanged. Main's `.superpowers/` and
`devenv.nix~`, and all other worktrees, are untouched.

Cycle 04 is now merged, including remote refs/state/reservation/observation
modules. Detailed API compatibility and baseline checks are the next gate.

## Implementation topology and ownership

Multi-seam change, partitioned by approved task contracts. All stages run
sequentially in the existing ticket worktree (no replacement worktree). Exactly
one active writer at a time; reviewer stages are fresh-context and read-only.
Each component must produce a committed handoff before integration. This serial
shape avoids shared `state.rs`/module wiring conflicts while honoring the user's
existing-worktree requirement.

| Lane | Exclusive contract / files while active | Next gate / handoff |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Baseline | API reconciliation; ledger, ticket comment only | Required Devenv baseline; stop on material incompatibility |
| Task 1 | Exact ref mappings, typed targets, pure graph evaluator; refs/state/mod/exports, private tests | Focused red/green tests, checkpoint commit, independent review |
| Task 2 | Durable envelope migration/replay/observation persistence; state/reservation/observation/recovery | Migration/recovery/privacy tests, checkpoint commit, independent review |
| Task 3 | Scoped exact authenticated transfers; transport operation/remote and focused tests | Selected-key/trust/ref-scope tests, checkpoint commit, independent review |
| Task 4 | Integration-only orchestration consuming Tasks 1–3; sync.rs and minimal wiring | Preflight/preservation/replay service tests, commit, independent review |
| Task 5 | Real SSH fixture evidence and CI target; synchronization tests/support/build.yml | Acceptance/privacy/index-only replay tests, commit, independent review |
| Task 6 | Full validation/evidence only, fixes routed to owning component | Required local gates, fresh whole-branch review; native CI pending publication authority |

## Task state

- Baseline: pending.
- Task 1: pending.
- Task 2: pending.
- Task 3: pending.
- Task 4: pending.
- Task 5: pending.
- Task 6: pending.

## Verification and review

No new Rust validation or implementation evidence yet. Native five-target CI
requires later authorized publication. Prior Cycle 04 results are not substituted
for fresh baseline or final Cycle 05 checks.
